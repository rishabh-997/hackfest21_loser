## Problem Statement
1. Identifying the right diagnosis for a given person at the earliest is one of the fundamental problems faced by healthcare providers.

2. For certain diseases like Cancer, late diagnosis threatens the chances of survival, chances of healthy lifestyle and also increases treatment costs.

3. Then there are problems such as is a lack of certified medicine practitioners,

4. Affordability of medical expenditures,

5. Significant amount of time taken to diagnose that particular disease. 

6. The physical access to hospitals is still the major barrier to both preventive and curative health services, forming the major differences between the Rural and the Urban India

## Medify.AI is a project which uses advanced techniques like AI to detect sudden health issues

Presently our application works for the following :

**ALZHEIMERS:** Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by severe memory loss and cognitive impairment. It is associated with significant brain structure changes, which can be measured by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.

**BREAST CANCER:** Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer among women, impacting 2.1 million women each year, and also causes the greatest number of cancer-related deaths among women.

**HEART DISEASES:** Heart diseases are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year. One-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age.

**LIVER DISEASES:** Liver disease can be inherited (genetic) or caused by a variety of factors that damage the liver, such as viruses and alcohol use. Obesity is also associated with liver damage. Over time, damage to the liver results in scarring which can lead to liver failure, a life-threatening condition.

**MELANOMA:** Skin cancer is an abnormal growth of skin cells. It generally develops in areas that are exposed to the sun, but it can also form in places that don’t normally get sun exposure

**DIABETIC RETINOGRAPGY:** Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is the fastest-growing cause of blindness. There are 415 Million people with diabetes in the world today, and each one is potentially at risk of being diagnosed with DR.

**COLOUR BLINDNESS:** Color blindness is the decreased ability to see color or differences in color. The Ishihara color test, which consists of a series of pictures of colored spots, is the test most often used to diagnose red-green color deficiencies.
 

## WHY MEDIFY.AI? 
 
Need to reduce the diagnosing time taken
The challenge here is that a trained human eye of a medical professional cannot identify subtle signs on these tests.
Low Accessibility and affordability:
The physical access to hospitals is still the major barrier to both preventive and curative health services, and also the major differences between the Rural and the Urban India. Besides, affordability of medical expenditures is one of the biggest problems faced by patients.

## Solution
Our web application using CNNs and ML that facilitates to test and predict the health risk of the patient based on his/her reports for which we have trained the models on unbiased and distributed datasets. 
To use our web-application, users have to simply upload their MRI scans depending upon the type of disease or cancer that they want to get diagnosed for. 
After taking the uploaded image as input, the CNNs model at backend will generate required heatmaps and predict whether the user has that disease or not. 
If yes, then the model would predict the stage of that disease/cancer with the probabilities. 
The model uses EfficientNet architecture for convolutional neural networks with the state of art techniques to predict results for different scans and inputs.

## Steps To Run the app on local host:

1. Create a virtual environment with the dependencies listed in requirements.txt
2. Make a subfolder and clone rest of the files there
3. Activate the virtual environment with command on root dir : source your_env_name/bin/activate
4. Change the location to subfolder and run app.py using python3 app.py

**USE CASES:**

Our software identifies the key factors/markers of health and fitness of an individual.
The usage and scope of the software is not limited to people,places or time.
The software is intentionally constructed to suit everyone especially the physically disabled and not limit to a sect of society.
